            <h5>The Power of One Plug</h5>
            <p>All of our lights are commercial-grade LEDs, which barely use any electricity. You can plug in dozens—even over a hundred strands—into a single outlet and it still won’t break a sweat. Everything’s on one timer, neat and tidy, so you don’t have to play electrician in your driveway.</p>

            <h5>The DIY Tangle</h5>
            <p>Now, if you go the big-box route—think Home Depot or Target—most of those strings max out at about 3 to 5 strands before the box literally tells you to stop. Try to light up a whole house that way and suddenly you’re juggling power strips, daisy chains, and hoping the breaker doesn’t trip right as the neighbors walk by. Not exactly the holiday magic you were going for.</p>
